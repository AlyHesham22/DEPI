# 📊 Medical Appointments Dashboard - Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

Successfully created a comprehensive, interactive data dashboard analyzing medical appointment no-show patterns using **110,527 appointment records** from Brazilian public hospitals. The dashboard provides actionable insights for healthcare administrators to understand and potentially reduce patient no-show rates.

## 📈 Key Findings & Insights

### 🔍 Overall Statistics
- **Show-up Rate:** 79.8% (88,208 appointments)
- **No-show Rate:** 20.2% (22,319 appointments) 
- **Average Patient Age:** 37.1 years
- **Average Waiting Time:** 9.2 days
- **Unique Patients:** 62,299
- **Neighborhoods Covered:** 81

### 👥 Demographic Insights
- **Gender:** Similar no-show rates between females (20.3%) and males (20.0%)
- **Age Groups:**
  - Children (0-17): 21.9% no-show rate
  - Young Adults (18-35): 23.8% no-show rate (highest)
  - Middle-aged (36-55): 19.7% no-show rate
  - Seniors (56+): 15.6% no-show rate (lowest)

### 🏥 Medical Conditions Impact
- **Patients with chronic conditions show LOWER no-show rates:**
  - Hypertension: 17.3% vs 20.9% (without condition)
  - Diabetes: 18.0% vs 20.4% (without condition)
  - Alcoholism: Similar rates (~20%)

### 📱 Surprising SMS Finding
- **Counterintuitive result:** Patients who received SMS reminders had HIGHER no-show rates (27.6% vs 16.7%)
- This suggests SMS reminders might be sent to high-risk patients or there's a selection bias

### 💰 Socioeconomic Factors
- **Scholarship recipients** (indicating lower income) have slightly higher no-show rates (23.7% vs 19.8%)

### ⏰ Timing Insights
- **Same-day appointments:** 4.7% of all appointments with 21.4% no-show rate
- **Maximum waiting time:** 178 days
- **Median waiting time:** 3 days

### 🏘️ Geographic Patterns
- **Neighborhood variation:** No-show rates range from ~15% to 29%
- **Top problem areas:** Santos Dumont (28.9%), Santa Cecília (27.5%), Santa Clara (26.5%)

## 💡 Business Recommendations

Based on the analysis, healthcare administrators should consider:

1. **Target Young Adults (18-35)** - Highest no-show rates (23.8%)
2. **Investigate SMS Strategy** - Current approach shows counterintuitive results
3. **Focus on High-Risk Neighborhoods** - Santos Dumont, Santa Cecília, etc.
4. **Leverage Chronic Condition Patients** - They're more reliable (lower no-show rates)
5. **Optimize Waiting Times** - Reduce median 3-day wait where possible
6. **Address Socioeconomic Barriers** - Scholarship recipients need extra support
